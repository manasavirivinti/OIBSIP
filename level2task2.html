            I really admire Sundar Pichai sir because sir began his career as a materials engineer. Following a 
            short stint at the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co., then joined Google in 2004, where he 
            led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products,
             including Google Chrome and ChromeOS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. In 
             addition, sir went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google 
             Maps. In 2010, Sir also announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and 
             introduced the new video format, Webm. The Chromebook was released in 2012. In 2013, Sir added
              Android to the list of Google products that he oversaw. Then, he was selected to become the 
              next CEO of Google on August 10,2015, after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO 
              Larry Page. On October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position at the completion of the 
              formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family. He was 
              appointed to the Alphabet Board of Directors in 2017 ....Such an incredible growth which is really inspiring
